# Kaggle Plant Seedlings
Repository with my code for [Kaggle Plant Seedlings Classification Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/plant-seedlings-classification)

## Getting started

To run the code please go to the 

## Library

I use [fast.ai library](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/tree/master/fastai).

## Data

In order to run the code you need to download the data from [the competition website](https://www.kaggle.com/c/plant-seedlings-classification/data) and put them into `data` directory.

To make the development faster, I've manually created a sample subset by taking 2 images from each class and using 4 test images. The data structure is the same as in the original data, but it's under `data/sample` directory.

## GPU

Since my computer doesn't have GPU, I used [Paperspace](www.paperspace.com)
